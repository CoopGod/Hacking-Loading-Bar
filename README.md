# Fake Hacking Loading Bar ðŸ”Œ
Made for a [Here Youth](https://www.hereyouth.ca/) event.

This project has green text falling from the top of the screen as a loading bar slowly increases. Under the loading bar, funny/cliche lines about hacking are displayed.
The idea behind the project was to make something akin to what people think hackers do/what hackers are 
shown to be like in movies.
